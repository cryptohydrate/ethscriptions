This photograph shows the very moment Alex noticed me, peaking out from under his thick spectacles, a yarmulke atop his head. He encouraged my curiousity, and stated boldly that he could craft a belt that would last 100 years. Mine had just broken, and he removed the buckle and repaired it for me. A final evening in New York staying on the Upper West Side, this memory preserved forever on blockchain by Drew Harrison Marshall.",
